纸牌游戏是娱乐场中常见的博弈游戏类别之一。早期纸牌大部分为数码牌，玩法通常是高点数胜低点数，或以特殊组合牌型取胜，此二原则仍为两大牌戏派别中论计胜负的标准。传说印度有棋盘式圆牌戏纯以技巧较胜负，但史籍未予详载；而波斯有所谓「阿斯那斯」（As Nas）玩法，被认为是现代牌戏发展的一个重要里程。尽管时闻昔日君王、贵族或政府，以严刑峻法禁止纸牌与牌戏，但此风仍盛行社会各阶层，也导致不少有名的纷争与决斗事件，其中包括1890年英格兰维多利亚时代贵族涉讼诈欺的川拜村巴卡拉式牌局（Tranby Croft Baccarat）丑闻。今天，桥牌已成为高雅的社交与智力活动，且赌纸牌的现象大为减少，於是，反对玩牌的呼声也大为减弱。

Solitaire is one of the most common types of games in the casino. Most of the early solitaires are digital, playing is usually a high-low point or winning with a special combination of cards. These two principles are still the standard of both games. Legend has it that chessboard card plays in India are more skillful than those in history, but history books have not been detailed, and Persian's so-called As Nas game is considered to be an important milestone in the development of modern cards. Despite the news that the kings, aristocrats or governments of the past have banned solitaire and card play under harsh austerity, this trend prevailed in all walks of life and led to many notable disputes and dueling events, including the 1890 aristocracy in Victorian England The Tranby Croft Baccarat Scandal. Today, the bridge has become elegant social and intellectual activities, and the phenomenon of playing cards is greatly reduced, so the opposition to playing cards also greatly weakened.
